<italic> <b>HTML</b> stands for <b>HyperText Markup Language.</b> It is the standard language
   used to create and structure content on the web. It tells the web browser how 
   to display text, links, images, and other forms of multimedia on a webpage. 
   HTML sets up the basic structure of a website, and then CSS and JavaScript add 
   style and interactivity to make it look and function better.</italic>

    <pre><italic>How Does HTML Work? - HTML documents are plain-text files saved with an <b>.html extension.</b> Browsers read these documents, interpret the markup (tags and attributes), and render the formatted content on your screen.</italic></pre>
